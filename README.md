# Necessary modules:
-numpy
-PyQt5
-matplotlib

# User instructions:

Run by opening and running main.py - after running, window with user input appears. In the user input window, add lenght L, support coordinates Xa and Xb, moment of inertia Jz and apply forces. Note that force or linear load facing downwards should be negative. After hitting the Solve! button, program computes numerically shear forces and bending moments in the beam. Note that number of divisions is fixed set at 10 000. Also since the calculation is numerical, user has to input somewhat reasonable values, otherwise the calculation might either take too long or not converge at all.

# Results:
Result is a matplotlib graph with input forces and another three graphs with shear forces, bending moments and displacements
